# Interface: IAgent

### env

> `readonly` **env**: `ResourceEnvironment`

The environment this resource belongs to.

For resources that are created and managed in a Stack (those created by
creating new class instances like `new Role()`, `new Bucket()`, etc.), this
is always the same as the environment of the stack they belong to.

For referenced resources (those obtained from referencing methods like
`Role.fromRoleArn()`, `Bucket.fromBucketName()`, etc.), they might be
different than the stack they were imported into.

#### Inherited from

`IResource.env`

Optional KMS encryption key associated with this agent

## Methods

### applyRemovalPolicy()

> **applyRemovalPolicy**(`policy`): `void`

Apply the given removal policy to this resource

The Removal Policy controls what happens to this resource when it stops
being managed by CloudFormation, either because you've removed it from the
CDK application or because you've made a change that requires the resource
to be replaced.

The resource can be deleted (`RemovalPolicy.DESTROY`), or left in your AWS
account for data recovery and cleanup later (`RemovalPolicy.RETAIN`).

#### Parameters

##### policy

`RemovalPolicy`

#### Returns

`void`
