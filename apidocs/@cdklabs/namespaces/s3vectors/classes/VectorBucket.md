# Class: VectorBucket

S3 vector bucket resource for AWS S3 vector buckets.
You can use this resource to create, modify, and manage vector buckets.

## See

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3vectors/latest/userguide/what-is-s3vectors.html

## Resource

AWS::S3::VectorBucket

## Extends

- [`VectorBucketBase`](VectorBucketBase.md)

## Constructors

### Constructor

> **new VectorBucket**(`scope`, `id`, `props?`): `VectorBucket`

#### Parameters

##### scope

`Construct`

##### id

`string`

##### props?

[`VectorBucketProps`](../interfaces/VectorBucketProps.md) = `{}`

#### Returns

`VectorBucket`

#### Overrides

[`VectorBucketBase`](VectorBucketBase.md).[`constructor`](VectorBucketBase.md#constructor)

## Properties

### autoCreatePolicy

> `protected` **autoCreatePolicy**: `boolean` = `true`

Indicates if a vector bucket resource policy should automatically be created upon
the first call to `addToResourcePolicy`.

#### Overrides

[`VectorBucketBase`](VectorBucketBase.md).[`autoCreatePolicy`](VectorBucketBase.md#autocreatepolicy)

***

### creationTime?

> `readonly` `optional` **creationTime**: `string`

The timestamp when the vector bucket was created, in ISO 8601 format.

#### Attribute

#### Overrides

[`VectorBucketBase`](VectorBucketBase.md).[`creationTime`](VectorBucketBase.md#creationtime)

***

### encryptionKey?

> `readonly` `optional` **encryptionKey**: `IKey`

KMS encryption key associated with this cluster.

#### Attribute

#### Overrides

[`VectorBucketBase`](VectorBucketBase.md).[`encryptionKey`](VectorBucketBase.md#encryptionkey)

***

### env

> `readonly` **env**: `ResourceEnvironment`

The environment this resource belongs to.

For resources that are created and managed in a Stack (those created by
creating new class instances like `new Role()`, `new Bucket()`, etc.), this
is always the same as the environment of the stack they belong to.

For referenced resources (those obtained from referencing methods like
`Role.fromRoleArn()`, `Bucket.fromBucketName()`, etc.), they might be
different than the stack they were imported into.

#### Inherited from

[`VectorBucketBase`](VectorBucketBase.md).[`env`](VectorBucketBase.md#env)

***

### node

> `readonly` **node**: `Node`

The tree node.

#### Inherited from

[`VectorBucketBase`](VectorBucketBase.md).[`node`](VectorBucketBase.md#node)

***

### physicalName

> `protected` `readonly` **physicalName**: `string`

Returns a string-encoded token that resolves to the physical name that
should be passed to the CloudFormation resource.

This value will resolve to one of the following:
- a concrete value (e.g. `"my-awesome-bucket"`)
- `undefined`, when a name should be generated by CloudFormation
- a concrete name generated automatically during synthesis, in
  cross-environment scenarios.

#### Inherited from

[`VectorBucketBase`](VectorBucketBase.md).[`physicalName`](VectorBucketBase.md#physicalname)

***

### policy?

> `optional` **policy**: [`VectorBucketPolicy`](VectorBucketPolicy.md)

The resource policy associated with this vector bucket.

If `autoCreatePolicy` is true, a `VectorBucketPolicy` will be created upon the
first call to addToResourcePolicy.

#### Overrides

[`VectorBucketBase`](VectorBucketBase.md).[`policy`](VectorBucketBase.md#policy)

***

### stack

> `readonly` **stack**: `Stack`

The stack in which this resource is defined.

#### Inherited from

[`VectorBucketBase`](VectorBucketBase.md).[`stack`](VectorBucketBase.md#stack)

***

### vectorBucketArn

> `readonly` **vectorBucketArn**: `string`

The ARN of the cluster

#### Attribute

#### Overrides

[`VectorBucketBase`](VectorBucketBase.md).[`vectorBucketArn`](VectorBucketBase.md#vectorbucketarn)

***

> `readonly` **vectorBucketName**: `string`

The name of the vector bucket

#### Attribute

#### Overrides

[`VectorBucketBase`](VectorBucketBase.md).[`vectorBucketName`](VectorBucketBase.md#vectorbucketname)

## Methods

### \_enableCrossEnvironment()

> **\_enableCrossEnvironment**(): `void`

**`Internal`**

Called when this resource is referenced across environments
(account/region) to order to request that a physical name will be generated
for this resource during synthesis, so the resource can be referenced
through its absolute name/arn.

#### Returns

`void`

#### Inherited from

[`VectorBucketBase`](VectorBucketBase.md).[`_enableCrossEnvironment`](VectorBucketBase.md#_enablecrossenvironment)

***

### addToResourcePolicy()

> **addToResourcePolicy**(`permission`): `AddToResourcePolicyResult`

Adds a statement to the resource policy for a principal (i.e.
account/role/service) to perform actions on this bucket and/or its
contents. Use `bucketArn` to obtain ARNs for
this bucket or objects.

Note that the policy statement may or may not be added to the policy.
For example, when an `IBucket` is created from an existing bucket,
it's not possible to tell whether the bucket already has a policy
attached, let alone to re-use that policy to add more statements to it.
So it's safest to do nothing in these cases.

#### Parameters

##### permission

`PolicyStatement`

the policy statement to be added to the bucket's
policy.

#### Returns

`AddToResourcePolicyResult`

metadata about the execution of this method. If the policy
was not added, the value of `statementAdded` will be `false`. You
should always check this value to make sure that the operation was
actually carried out. Otherwise, synthesis and deploy will terminate
silently, which may be confusing.

#### Inherited from

[`VectorBucketBase`](VectorBucketBase.md).[`addToResourcePolicy`](VectorBucketBase.md#addtoresourcepolicy)

***

### applyRemovalPolicy()

> **applyRemovalPolicy**(`policy`): `void`

Apply the given removal policy to this resource

The Removal Policy controls what happens to this resource when it stops
being managed by CloudFormation, either because you've removed it from the
CDK application or because you've made a change that requires the resource
to be replaced.

The resource can be deleted (`RemovalPolicy.DESTROY`), or left in your AWS
account for data recovery and cleanup later (`RemovalPolicy.RETAIN`).

#### Parameters

##### policy

`RemovalPolicy`

#### Returns

`void`

#### Inherited from

[`VectorBucketBase`](VectorBucketBase.md).[`applyRemovalPolicy`](VectorBucketBase.md#applyremovalpolicy)

***

### generatePhysicalName()

> `protected` **generatePhysicalName**(): `string`

#### Returns

`string`

#### Inherited from

[`VectorBucketBase`](VectorBucketBase.md).[`generatePhysicalName`](VectorBucketBase.md#generatephysicalname)

***

### getResourceArnAttribute()

> `protected` **getResourceArnAttribute**(`arnAttr`, `arnComponents`): `string`

Returns an environment-sensitive token that should be used for the
resource's "ARN" attribute (e.g. `bucket.bucketArn`).

Normally, this token will resolve to `arnAttr`, but if the resource is
referenced across environments, `arnComponents` will be used to synthesize
a concrete ARN with the resource's physical name. Make sure to reference
`this.physicalName` in `arnComponents`.

#### Parameters

##### arnAttr

`string`

The CFN attribute which resolves to the ARN of the resource.
Commonly it will be called "Arn" (e.g. `resource.attrArn`), but sometimes
it's the CFN resource's `ref`.

##### arnComponents

`ArnComponents`

The format of the ARN of this resource. You must
reference `this.physicalName` somewhere within the ARN in order for
cross-environment references to work.

#### Returns

`string`

#### Inherited from

[`VectorBucketBase`](VectorBucketBase.md).[`getResourceArnAttribute`](VectorBucketBase.md#getresourcearnattribute)

***

### getResourceNameAttribute()

> `protected` **getResourceNameAttribute**(`nameAttr`): `string`

Returns an environment-sensitive token that should be used for the
resource's "name" attribute (e.g. `bucket.bucketName`).

Normally, this token will resolve to `nameAttr`, but if the resource is
referenced across environments, it will be resolved to `this.physicalName`,
which will be a concrete name.

#### Parameters

##### nameAttr

`string`

The CFN attribute which resolves to the resource's name.
Commonly this is the resource's `ref`.

#### Returns

`string`

#### Inherited from

[`VectorBucketBase`](VectorBucketBase.md).[`getResourceNameAttribute`](VectorBucketBase.md#getresourcenameattribute)

***

### isConstruct()

> `static` **isConstruct**(`x`): `x is Construct`

Checks if `x` is a construct.

Use this method instead of `instanceof` to properly detect `Construct`
instances, even when the construct library is symlinked.

Explanation: in JavaScript, multiple copies of the `constructs` library on
disk are seen as independent, completely different libraries. As a
consequence, the class `Construct` in each copy of the `constructs` library
is seen as a different class, and an instance of one class will not test as
`instanceof` the other class. `npm install` will not create installations
like this, but users may manually symlink construct libraries together or
use a monorepo tool: in those cases, multiple copies of the `constructs`
library can be accidentally installed, and `instanceof` will behave
unpredictably. It is safest to avoid using `instanceof`, and using
this type-testing method instead.

#### Parameters

##### x

`any`

Any object

#### Returns

`x is Construct`

true if `x` is an object created from a class which extends `Construct`.
