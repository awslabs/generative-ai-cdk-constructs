## Properties

### embeddingsModelVectorDimension

> `readonly` **embeddingsModelVectorDimension**: `number`

The embeddings model vector dimension for the knowledge base.
Must be identical as in the KnowledgeBase construct.
This is due to the factor that the embeddings models
have different vector dimensions and this construct
needs to know the vector dimensions to create the vector
index of appropriate dimensions in the Aurora database.

***

### vpc?

> `readonly` `optional` **vpc**: `IVpc`

The VPC where the Aurora Vector Store will be deployed in.
The provided VPC must have at least one subnet of type
`ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC` and at least one subnet of type
`ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS`. If no subnets of these
types are available, the deployment will fail.
If not provided, a new VPC with the required subnet
configuration will be created automatically.

#### Default

```ts
- "A new VPC will be created."
```
