## Properties

### description?

> `readonly` `optional` **description**: `string`

The description of the knowledge base.

### env

> `readonly` **env**: `ResourceEnvironment`

The environment this resource belongs to.
For resources that are created and managed by the CDK
(generally, those created by creating new class instances like Role, Bucket, etc.),
this is always the same as the environment of the stack they belong to;
however, for imported resources
(those obtained from static methods like fromRoleArn, fromBucketName, etc.),
that might be different than the stack they were imported into.

### instruction?

> `readonly` `optional` **instruction**: `string`

## Methods

### applyRemovalPolicy()
