Most of the helper functions in this folder are extracted from: https://github.com/awslabs/aws-solutions-constructs 

The helper library includes the basic building blocks of the Generative AI construct library. It defines the core classes that are used in the rest of the library. The purpose is to standardize and accelerate development for builders.
These methods should not be used by end customers.
