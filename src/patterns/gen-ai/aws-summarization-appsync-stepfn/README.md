## Overview

This construct provides a workflow to summarize multiple pdf documents with Amazon Bedrock using Anthropic Claude V2 as foundation model, AWS AppSync for Graphql apis, AWS Step Functions and AWS Lambda functions.

A Graphql request is submitted with the list of files which needs to be summarized by the construct.

AWS AppSync forward the request to an Amazon EventBridge through an event bridge data source resolver. Amazon EventBridge decouple the whole architecture and it forwards the request to AWS Step Function for further processing.

AWS Step Function implements a workflow to validate the input request, then process and transform the files in parallel and finally generate the summary of each file. For user specific configuration please refer to the Pattern construct Props.

The status of each file is sent back to the client through an AppSync subscription.

This construct builds a Lambda function from a Docker image, thus you need to have [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) running on your machine.

The input document(s) must be stored in the input Amazon Simple Storage Service bucket in text format (.txt). Another construct is available to ingest and process files to text format: [aws-rag-appsync-stepfn-opensearch](../aws-rag-appsync-stepfn-opensearch/README.md).

Make sure the model (anthropic.claude-v2) is enabled in your account. Please follow the [Amazon Bedrock User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html) for steps related to enabling model access.

AWS Lambda functions provisioned in this construct use [Powertools for AWS Lambda (Python)](https://github.com/aws-powertools/powertools-lambda-python) for tracing, structured logging and custom metrics creation.

Here is a minimal deployable pattern definition:

Create a CDK typescript project and then update the stack with below configuration.

``` typescript
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { Stack, StackProps } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as cognito from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-cognito';
import { SummarizationAppsyncStepfn, SummarizationAppsyncStepfnProps } from '@awslabs/generative-ai-cdk-constructs';

// get an existing userpool 
const cognitoPoolId = 'us-east-1_XXXXX';
const userPoolLoaded = cognito.UserPool.fromUserPoolId(this, 'myuserpool', cognitoPoolId);

summarizationTestConstruct = new SummarizationAppsyncStepfn(
    this, 
    'SummarizationAppsyncStepfn', 
    {
        cognitoUserPool: userPoolLoaded
    });
    
```

For optional props like redis cluster set cfnCacheClusterProps.

```
const cfnCacheClusterProps: elasticache.CfnCacheClusterProps = {
      cacheNodeType: 'cache.r6g.xlarge',
      engine: 'redis',
      numCacheNodes: 1,
    };
```
If file transformation is required set isFileTransformationRequired to 'True'

 ```
 isFileTransformationRequired: 'True'
 ```

For existing resource like Amazon VPC , Amazon S3 buckets use props like existingVpc, existingInputAssetsBucketObj and existingProcessedAssetsBucketObj.

The code below provides an example of a mutation call and associated subscription to trigger the summarization workflow and get response notifications:

Mutation call to trigger the question:

```
mutation MyMutation {
  generateSummary(summaryInput:{files:[{name: "document1.txt", status: ""}], summary_job_id:"81"}) {
    name
    status
    summary
    summary_job_id
  }
}
```

Where:
- summary_job_id: id which can be used to filter subscriptions on client side
- status: this field will be used by the subscription to update the status of the summarization process for the file(s) specified
- name: Two formats are supported for files to be summarized. If the file is in text format, it needs to be stored in the trasformed S3 bucket, no file transformation is required. 
If pdf format is selected, the file needs to be in the input S3 bucket and the construct prop ```isFileTransformationRequired``` needs to be set to true. The file will be transformed to text format.

Subscription call to get notifications about the summarization process:
```
subscription MySubscription {
  updateSummaryJobStatus(name: "document1.txt", summary_job_id: "81") {
    name
    status
    summary
    summary_job_id
  }
}
```

Where:
- summary_job_id: id which can be used to filter subscriptions on client side
- status: status update of the summarization process for the file(s) specified
- name: name of the file stored in the input S3 bucket, same name + extension as passed to the previous mutation call.
- summary: summary returned by the Large Language Model for the document specified, as a base64 encoded string

```If multiple files are requested for summarization , then the client should filter response based on summary_job_id and name for each file. ```

## Initializer

```
new SummarizationAppsyncStepfn(scope: Construct, id: string, props: SummarizationAppsyncStepfnProps)
```

Parameters

- scope [Construct](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/constructs.Construct.html)
- id string

## Cost

You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this construct. As of this revision, the cost for running this construct with the default settings in the US East (N. Virginia) Region is approximately $X per month.

We recommend creating a budget through [AWS Cost Explorer](http://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/) to help manage costs. Prices are subject to change. For full details, refer to the pricing webpage for each AWS service used in this solution.

The following table provides a sample cost breakdown for deploying this solution with the default parameters in the **US East (N. Virginia)** Region for **one month**.


| **AWS Service**     | **Dimensions**        | **Cost [USD]** |
|:-------------|:----------------|-----------------|
| AWS Step Functions | 15 requests per hour for summarization, each with 2 files (4 steps per workflow) | 0.99 |
| Amazon Virtual Private Cloud |  | 0.00 |
| AWS AppSync | 15 requests per hour to trigger summarization + (15 x 4 calls to notify clients through subscriptions) = 54,000 requests per month | 0.22 |
| Amazon EventBridge | 15 requests per hour = 10800 custom events per month | 0.01 |
| AWS Lambda | 15 summarization requests per hour with 2 files each time, through 4 Lambda functions each allocated with 7076 MB of memory allocated and 512 MB of ephemeral storage allocated and an average run time of 30 seconds = 43200 requests per month. This cost would reduce if redis cache is used which will skip lambda invocation. | 142.59 |
| Amazon Simple Storage Service | 15 requests per hour for summarization with 2 files in input format (PDF) with an average size of 1MB and transformed files to text format with an average size of 1 MB = 43.2 GB per month in S3 Standard Storage | 0.99 |
| Amazon Bedrock | With the on-demand mode, for text generation models, you are charged for every input token processed and every output token generated. Anthropic.claude model price for 1000 input tokens= $0.01102 and for 1000 output tokens = $0.03268. With a pdf of 50 pages (asumming each page having 200 words) , 50 * 200 , there are 10000 words, which are ~= 7500 tokens. Input token cost for 200 request per month = 7.5 * 0.01102 * 200 = 16.53. Asumming a summary of 200 words (150 tokens) for 200 requests per month cost of output token  = 150 * (0.03268/1000) * 200 = 9.804. Total cost for 200 summary requests , 16.53 + 9.804 = $26.334| 26.334 |
| Amazon ElastiCache for Redis | With on-demand Instance type as 'cache.m4.large' and with 1 node the expecxted cost is  1 instance(s) x 0.156 USD hourly x (100 / 100 Utilized/Month) x 730 hours in a month = 113.8800 | 113.88 |
| Amazon Cloudwatch | 15 metrics using 5 GB data ingested for logs | 7.02 |
| AWS X-Ray | 100,000 requests per month through AppSync and Lambda calls | 0.50 |
| Total Deployment cost | | |

The resources not created by this construct (Amazon Cognito User Pool, AppSync Merged API, AWS Secrets Manager secret) do not appear in the table above. You can refer to the decicated pages to get an estimate of the cost related to those services:
- [AWS AppSync pricing (for Merged API if used)](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/pricing/)
- [Amazon Cognito Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/pricing/)
- [AWS Secrets Manager Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/pricing/)

## Security

When you build systems on AWS infrastructure, security responsibilities are shared between you and AWS. This [shared responsibility](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) model reduces your operational burden because AWS operates, manages, and controls the components including the host operating system, virtualization layer, and physical security of the facilities in which the services operate. For more information about AWS security, visit [AWS Cloud Security](http://aws.amazon.com/security/).

## Supported AWS Regions

This solution optionally uses the Amazon Bedrock service, which is not currently available in all AWS Regions. You must launch this construct in an AWS Region where these services are available. For the most current availability of AWS services by Region, see the [AWS Regional Services List](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/).

> **Note**
>You need to explicity enable access to models before they are available for use in the Amazon Bedrock service. Please follow the [Amazon Bedrock User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html) for steps related to enabling model access.

## Quotas

Service quotas, also referred to as limits, are the maximum number of service resources or operations for your AWS account.

Make sure you have sufficient quota for each of the services implemented in this solution. For more information, refer to [AWS service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html).

To view the service quotas for all AWS services in the documentation without switching pages, view the information in the [Service endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-general.pdf#aws-service-information) page in the PDF instead.
