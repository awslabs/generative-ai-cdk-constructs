[Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies and Amazon through a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI.

This construct library facilitates the deployment of Amazon Bedrock resources through a higher level, L2 set of constructs. It leverages underlying CloudFormation L1 resources to provision these Bedrock features.
