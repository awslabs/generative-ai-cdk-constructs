Amazon Aurora DSQL is the fastest serverless distributed SQL database with active-active high availability to help ensure your applications are always available. It ensures all reads and writes to any Regional endpoint are strongly consistent and durable. Moreover, its serverless design makes database management effortless, offering virtually unlimited scalability and zero infrastructure management.

This construct library provides L2 constructs to manage Aurora DSQL resources.

## Aurora DSQL Cluster

Aurora DSQL provides several configuration options to help you establish the right database infrastructure for your needs. To set up your Aurora DSQL cluster infrastructure, review the following sections.

### Cluster properties

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| removalPolicy | RemovalPolicy | No | This option prevents accidental cluster deletion. When set to RETAIN, you can't delete the cluster. By default, RemovalPolicy.DESTROY is applied. |
| kmsKey | IKey | No | A custom KMS key to use for encrypting data. Default: Your data is encrypted by default with a key that AWS owns and manages for you. |
| multiRegionProperties | MultiRegionProperties | No | Structure for multi-Region cluster configurations. Default: single region configuration. |
| tags | Record<string, string> | No | Tags to apply to the cluster. Default: no tags applied. |

### Single region cluster

```typescript
new auroraDsql.Cluster(stack, 'TestCluster', {});
```

You can use tags on a cluster, for instance:

```typescript
new auroraDsql.Cluster(this, 'TestCluster', {
    tags: {
        Name: 'TestCluster',
    }
});
```

### Multi region cluster

Multi-Region peered clusters provide the same resilience and connectivity as single-Region clusters. But they improve availability by offering two Regional endpoints, one in each peered cluster Region. Both endpoints of a peered cluster present a single logical database. They are available for concurrent read and write operations, and provide strong data consistency. You can build applications that run in multiple Regions at the same time for performance and resilienceâ€”and know that readers always see the same data.

```typescript
// create a cluster in a different region
const peeredCluster1 = new auroraDsql.Cluster(stack1, 'TestPeeredCluster1', {});

// or load existing cluster through the fromAttributes method

new Cluster(stack3, 'TestCluster', {
    multiRegionProperties: {
        witnessRegion: 'us-east-1',
        clusters: [peeredCluster1],
    },
});
```
