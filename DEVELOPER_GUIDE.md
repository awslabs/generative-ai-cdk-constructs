# Developer Guide

AWS Generative AI CDK Constructs are built in TypeScript using Projen (http://projen.io/). This is to support all the associated testing, code checking, and compilation for TypeScript and Python client. At the moment, there is no dedicated development container, thus you need to configure your local development environment following the steps described below.

### Pre-requisites

- An AWS account. We recommend you deploy this solution in a new account
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/): configure your credentials

```
aws configure --profile [your-profile] 
AWS Access Key ID [None]: xxxxxx
AWS Secret Access Key [None]:yyyyyyyyyy
Default region name [None]: us-east-1 
Default output format [None]: json
```

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) >= v20.9.0
- [AWS CDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v2.122.0) >= 2.122.0
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >=3.9
- [Projen](https://github.com/projen/projen) >= 0.78.8
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/install/) >= 1.22.19

You can use the command below to install the dependencies listed above
```
npm install -g npm aws-cdk yarn projen
```

| *Do all your code editing*                        | Open your code editor and create the construct or perform your edits on an existing construct.

If you need to bundle additional code, add it to a separate folder in the root folder of this repo (see existing examples, like `lambda` and `resources` folders.) Use an existing construct as an example of the structure that is expected (architecture.png, README.md, index.ts). For the architecture diagram of your construct, please use the provided Draw.io project located in the /docs folder. Create a new tab with your construct name. Finally, export your construct in the src/index.ts file. An example of the expected project structure is provided at the end of this document. Common code containing helper functions to standardize and accelerate development is located in the src/common folder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `npx projen build`                                | This is the build command for the library. It will build, lint, add license header files, and run the unit and integration tests. If you make any substantive changes to the code, you will almost certainly see some or all of the tests fail. The next section will describe how testing works in AWS Generative AI CDK Constructs and how to write, refresh, and execute tests. In the meantime, you can at least check if your code transpiles correctly without running the tests by running `npm run build`. If you've edited any modules in /core in addition to a construct, be sure to build /core before building your construct. This command also packages the constructs locally to the /dist folder. |

## Testing

AWS Generative AI CDK Constructs use two types of testing: unit testing and integration testing. Unit testing targets specific aspects of a construct or one of the functions in the core library. It examines the results and confirms the correct resources are there. For instance, it may call the deployLambdaFunction() in the core library and then confirm that AWS_NODEJS_CONNECTION_REUSE_ENABLED environment variable was set correctly. The unit tests check that certain aspects of the results are correct. You can learn more about unit testing CDK constructs [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/testing.html) and [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/testing-infrastructure-with-the-aws-cloud-development-kit-cdk/).

All test files can be found in the /test directory under each construct (or core). You'll find two types of files in this directory:

* \*.test.ts files - these are the unit test files. All the unit tests for a construct are in a single file.
* integ.\*.ts files - these the integration test files. Each integration test gets a separate file.

| `npx projen test` | This will run all tests (unit+integration) |

## Testing Your Construct Locally

- Using the samples repository to test your locally changed constructs. This is also useful for development.

### Pre-req:
- Download the samples repository (The official samples repository https://github.com/aws-samples/generative-ai-cdk-constructs-samples includes a collection of functional use case implementations to demonstrate the usage of AWS Generative AI CDK Constructs. These can be used in the same way as architectural patterns, and can be conceptualized as an additional "higher-level" abstraction of those patterns. Those patterns (constructs) are composed together into [stacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/stacks.html), forming a "CDK app".
)


### Step 1: Building the Generative AI CDK Construct

Navigate to the [Generative AI CDK Construct Repository] (https://github.com/aws-samples/generative-ai-cdk-constructs-samples):
    Open your command line interface and change directory to the generative AI CDK construct repository.

- Execute the command ```yarn build```. 
  - This command runs npx projen build and generates a .jsii file in your repository.

### Step 2: Packaging the Constructs
1. Run Yarn Package:JS:
    - Execute ```yarn package:js```.
      - This command creates a new .tgz package of all constructs in the dist/js folder.

2. Locate the TGZ File:
    - Find the generated .tgz file, typically named something like dist/js/generative-ai-cdk-constructs-0.0.0.jsii.tgz.


### Step 3: Integrating with Sample Application

1. Drag and Drop the TGZ File:
    - Drag and drop the .tgz file into your samples repository, ideally at the root like "samples/document_explorer".

2. Modify package.json in Sample Repo:
    - Open package.json in your samples repository.
    - Under dependencies, locate the entry for "@cdklabs/generative-ai-cdk-constructs".
    - Replace the existing entry with file:<path-to-tgz-file>. For example: 
    ```
...
  "dependencies": {
    "@cdklabs/generative-ai-cdk-constructs": "file:generative-ai-cdk-constructs@0.0.0.jsii.tgz",
...
    ```

### Step 4: Deploying to AWS

1. Navigate to Sample Repo Directory:
  - Change directory to your samples repository.
2. AWS CDK Deployment:
  - Ensure you are authenticated to AWS with the necessary permissions.
  - Run ```cdk deploy``` to deploy the new backend with your generative AI constructs into the AWS Cloud.
3. Verify Deployment:
  - Log into your AWS console and verify that the resources have been deployed successfully.
  - Check for any errors in the AWS CloudFormation console and address them as necessary.

### Testing and Verification

- After deployment, you may want to test the functionalities of the generative AI constructs in the AWS environment.
- Ensure all integrations and functionalities are working as expected.
